# Peculia - a fabric mod that aims to add onto Minecraft's fun gameplay without making it boring.
made by LunarLuned, major help from Ambient_ (or AmbientUnder) for texture work and composing, and Sydokiddo with assistance on coding.

If you record anything with this mod, or put it in a modpack, please do credit me somehow! If its linking to the mod page, or the twitter, or something--please include a link back. It helps a lot!!

also : for any mod makers, you can use my code as a reference for whatever you may need, mi casa es su casa etc etc. Credit is really optional here as I cant like. enforce this part?? cause its. just working code, but if you want to, go ahead! it's appreciated if ya do :)
